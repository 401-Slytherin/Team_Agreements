### Data Flow

When the user gets to the front page, they will be greeted with a welcome message. The user can then choose to log in if they have an account, sign up if they do not have an account or go straight into browsing items in web apps catalog. `**users will only be able to buy/sell/trade if they have an account and are signed in**`. Once a user is signed in, if they would like to buy, they can browse the same catalog that is available for non-signed in users that will be available for purchase. If users would like to sell, they can click on the SELL link that will direct them to a form to fill out, detailing the card they would like to sell. Users have the ability to upload images of their card they would like to sell as well a listing the condition and authenticity, and promotional value, if it applicable. Users can also view and edit their account profiles as well as being able to see a list of all the items they are currently selling and a wishlist (STRETCH) of the items they are looking for.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Usability - the Web application is very straight forward and easy to use. Users can either browse items freely without the option to buy/sell/trade, or they can sign up or log in. Buying, selling, or trading is very straight forward as well.
2. Scalability - The web app can be expanded to allow users to buy/sell/trade miscellaneous items such as collectible figurines, boardgames, etc. as well as different categorized items.
